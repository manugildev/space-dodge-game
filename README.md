<h3>Reskin & Customization</h3>
Space Dodge has been designed so that you can change anything: buttons, fonts, sounds, all images and colors… The game also provides an easy way to use your own assets or images for the different elements of the game. <br>

We have created a Configuration File and a Settings File where you can change all the encoded values. There you can find all the IDs that need to be changed (Admob IDs, Leaderboard IDs…) and see the final result on your game.
